# Profit and Loss Analysis Script

## Overview

This Python script analyzes a CSV file containing financial data to calculate various metrics, including:
- Total number of months in the dataset
- Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- Average change in "Profit/Losses"
- Greatest increase in profits (date and amount)
- Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount)

The script assumes that the CSV file contains columns for date and profit/loss amounts. The date format in the CSV should be `Month-Year` (e.g., `Jan-10`).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `os`, `csv`, `datetime`
